Description: WordPress themes usually have some nice design behind, which makes your blog look cool. The assumption behind themes was simple: let's allow user to be able to swap between themes with only one (or maybe few) clicks of the mouse. The only problem is, that usually it's not this easy... Personally I like WordPress CMS. It's very well designed, looks good and works just fine - as a simple CMS it offers a lot of really good features. But the problem is that the blog-like structure of it, and therfore of themes as well, makes you hate it, because as a web developer you can't really spread your wings and fly. Instead you dig deep down trying to find a shortcut home. In **WP-JSON** case I focused only on one functionality. Its job is serving the content in **JSON** format. Everything you can possibly want or need. Then outside of WordPress weird and structural structure, you can build really nice web application fed by JSON. I hope that with this theme you will be proud, that your website is **_powered by WordPress_**.
